# I'm Sorryplspls! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer from Norway with a passion for creating and learning new things. I specialize in Java (4+ years of experience), and I also work with SQL development, Python, and abit of HTML. My journey has been full of learning opportunities, collaborating with amazing people, and handling interesting challenges.

I enjoy building software that is both functional and fun, while constantly expanding my knowledge in backend and full-stack development. Whether it's coding, debugging, or crying for solutions ðŸ˜‚

I tend to keep most of my code private due to most my work being private or bought, but if you are interested in seeing source code for a feature made by me then contact me at ðŸ’¬
